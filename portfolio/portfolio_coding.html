			<h1>Code Ethics</h1>

			<div class="odd_row" style="background-image: url('public/images/LoveOpenSource.png')">
				<h2>Open Source</h2>
				<!-- "Beware of he who would deny you access to information, for in his heart he dreams himself your master."<br>
				* Sid Meier's Alpha Centauri - 1999<br> -->
				I just flat out don't like beurocracy, so working on open source software is my way to share and hone my skills without having to feel compromised.  Besides, there is nothing in the world that's better at getting between a good idea and its implementation than closed source code and a "busy" manager.


			</div>

			<div style="background-image: url('public/images/NoBloat.png')">
				<h2 class="">No Bloat</h2>
				It's just a matter of cleanliness.  There are a lot of users and businesses that either refuse to use or don't understand updates and working around them often creates bloat.  These aren't the kind of people nor habits I care to burden myself with.
			</div>
			

			<div class="odd_row" style="background-image: url('public/images/pioneer_icon.png')">
				<h2>Explorative</h2>
				It's not exactly an ethic, but I'm much more enthused about the future than I am the past.  Certainly, many great things have been done, but rather than learning to recreate or emulate them, I prefer to get my hands dirty trying to explore the unexplored.  Pioneering, in a modern sense.
			</div>

			<div style="background-image: url('public/images/sad_puppy.png')">
				<h2>Humane</h2>
				The world is as boned as it ever needed to be and some.  But more importantly, the best things in my life could never have been paid for, they came from a certain type of chaos.  It's a strange mixture of goodwill, resources, and freedom that creates the greatest stories, and I really like a good story.

			<h1>My Toolset</h1>

			<div class="odd_row" style="background-image: url('public/images/html5-css3-js.png')">
				<h2>HTML 5, CSS 3, Javascript</h2>
				I've been working with HTML since age 12, CSS the past 6 years, and Javascript the past four years. Javascript is one of my newest languages, but it is also one of my favorites, mostly due to its portability and transparency.

			</div>

		
			<div style="background-image: url('public/images/zepto_icon.png')">
				<h2>Zepto (JQuery, JQuip)</h2>
				Zepto, JQuery, and JQuip are all plugins which help with dom traversal using the standard syntax. The only differences are that JQuery is really bloated, JQuip is the modular version of JQuery, and Zepto is built from scratch for the sake of being thin.  If you know one, you know all three.
				
			</div>

			<div class="odd_row" style="background-image: url('public/images/greensock_icon.png')">
				<h2>Green Sock Animations Plugin</h2>
				GSAP is a really powerful web animations plugin.  It's not Flash (thank heavens), but it can do a lot of flashy animations using some fancy css manipulations and a goot bit of hardware acceleration.
			</div>

			<div style="background-image: url('public/images/cordova_icon.png')">
				<h2>Cordova</h2>
				Cordova is the open source tool that Adobe copied, changed for the worse, and then pasted their name on as "PhoneGap."  It's a bridge between web design and phone apps (cameras, microphones, contact lists, ect.)
				
			</div>

			<div class="odd_row" style="background-image: url('public/images/mysql_icon.png')">
				<h2>MySQL</h2>
				MySQL is the database manager I'm most familiar with, but they're all fairly similar.  I've built a couple websites around big data dreams, and took a class in SQL jedi-ism.
			</div>


			<div style="background-image: url('public/images/pine_logo.png')">
				<h2>PINE</h2>
				PINE is a tool I built myself for creating functional user interfaces.  It's pretty rad, and there's more about it in my "Showcase" section.
			</div>

			<div class="odd_row" style="background-image: url('public/images/three_icon.png')">
				<h2>Three.js</h2>
				Currently, this is my favorite new tool.  It's what I used to make the moving 3d logo at the top of the page and the "3d Walkscape" showcased below. In my opinion, it is without any doubt the future of the web.  It's incredible.
			</div>
			


			<div style="background-image: url('public/images/java_icon.png')">
				<h2>Java</h2>
				Java was my bread and butter for a long time, but I've since moved to Javascript for the sake of portability and UI tools (which html/css have plenty of).
			</div>

			
			<div class="odd_row" style="background-image: url('public/images/pastcode_icon.png')">
				<h2>C++, Python, GoLang, PHP</h2>
				These are all languages I've worked with, but were not productive enough for me to create anything truly presentable.  I don't use them anymore, but I still know them fairly well.

				Everything you see here is made from scratch using Javascript, CSS, HTML, SVG, SketchUp, Blender, Gimp, Three.js, Zepto (a thin JQuery), and Green Sock.  There was no templates of any sort used for this or anything else I ever make.  Also, this page is mobile friendly.  Try scaling your window!

				This is a deep one.  The amount of things which went into this framework are pretty expansive.  I can't really do it justice in so few words, but I can say I'm very proud of it.  I made it to compete with Googles "AngularJs" and Facebooks "React," and though it will never get their publicity or reach, I can say it does for me what their libraries could not, while being much slimmer.

				(current) For this project I'm using Three.js, SketchUp, and Blender to make a small, scenic, 3d world.  So far it has realistic looking water, perlin noise generated hills, a beautiful skybox, randomly placed trees, some very rough physics emulation, and a little house with a door you can open and close.  The project is only barely started, but the hope is that it will someday be the beautiful pine forest land I will probably never own.<br>

				<h2>Effigy Flame Effects Sequencer - (Java)</h2>
				What started off as a simple way to test what a group of flame throwers would look like when triggered by buttons eventually evolved into an entire sequencing program which can import and export MIDI, and has its own propriety file extension for projects called a .feg (F E G == Effigy).  The program also has algorithms which can be combined with different patterns to create even crazier patterns.  This year it will be premiering at a small festival called "Flipside," and the hopes for it are high.

				I got really tired of w3 schools coming up in my searches so I made a chrome extension to "Blam" it.  Unfortunately, upon uploading the finished extension, I got an email from Google saying that my developer account was suspended and all my extesions were taken down without any explanation as to why and no extra information I might use to fix the situation.  Eventually (a week later) my account was re-instated, also without any explanation, but by that point I'd already sworn off using Google products as much as possible.  It's been a lot like dieting.  At first is was kind of hard, but, looking back, Google is kind of icky. Anyways, the point is that I abandoned this project as a result, but will eventually be porting it to Firefox.<br>

				<h2>Banking App - (Rapid Prototyping)</h2>
				My girlfriend is in school for interaction design and had to redesign a banking app.  Unfortunately, neither her nor most people in the field of design know how to use HTML/CSS, so instead they use Illustrator, which is cofoundingly unresouceful.  It got to the point where the time and stress of the project were getting hard for me to handle, so I redesigned her entire app as a working prototype, pixel for pixel, in about a day.  Then I proceeded to fork the project and redesign it the way I think a banking app should be.  Had I been doing this in illustrator, I would have had to start from scratch, which is fucking crazy!  But in the end, I realized the ability to think of something and then make it takes a lot longer to learn in html/css than it does in Illustrator, so I guess it makes sense that people use that tool instead.<br><br>
				I never ended up porting the webapp to an actual phone but I could do it almost effortlessly using Apache Cordova, or Ionic if need be.<br>

			<h1>The Making of this Portfolio</h1>

			<div class="odd_row" style="background-image: url('public/images/thumbz_icon.png')">
				<h2>From Scratch</h2>
				Pretty much everything you see here, I made.  There's a few icons I took straight from the web (such as the twitter one up top), and the stars at the top of the page are basically <a href="http://threejs.org/examples/#webgl_points_random">this three.js example</a> with a few things tweaked.  But the rest of this is not copy pasted, nor in imitation of anything.
			</div>

			<div class="odd_row">
				<h2>"The Process"</h2>
				<ul>
					<li>
						<u>3D Header</u> - 3d shape was created from two of the initial 2d ones using SketchUp and some imagination.  Then it was exported to Blender where the excess vertecies which SketchUp uses were removed.  Next, it wast imported into a Three.js scene and special controls were made for the sake of rotating the object to find the most interesting angles.  The camera was also made to not show perspective in order to keep the geometry looking flat.  Once a few pleasing angles were found, they were put into an array from which they are chosen at random and tweened to.  As for the stars, they are just randomly placed vertecies on a couple of rotating meshes with PointMaterials applied to them.
					</li>


					<li>
						<u>Icons</u> - All of the icons were made using Gimp.
					</li>

					<li>
						<u>Logic</u> - For the page logic Zepto, a slimmer replacement for JQuery, was used.  One of the coolest things it is doing is finding links which point to other places in the same page and changing their functionality to include a scolling animation.  It's also being used to show and hide elements.
					</li>

					<li>
						<u>Animations</u> - Whenever possible, simple CSS was used for the animations.  For complex animations (such as scrolling the page around, or sliding in the pop in bar) Green Sock was used.  Green sock is far superior to JQuery animation, and while many of the functions in JQuery are still very useful, overriding its animation functions is bad code style.  That's why Zepto was used instead.
					</li>

					<li>
						<u>Strange Shapes</u> - For the the "pop in" bottom bar, SVG tags were used.  The benefit of using svg tags to create special shapes is that you can change their colors, strokes, sizes, and shapes all while having them be pixel perfect.
					</li>

					<li>
						<u>Coding/Testing</u> - All of the coding for this page was done in Sublime Text 2, and all of the testing was done using Firefox Developer Tools.
					</li>			
				</ul>
