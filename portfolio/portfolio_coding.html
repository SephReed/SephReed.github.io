				<div class="project_and_description">
					<imgArea><img src="public/images/Docurizer_overview.gif"></imgArea>
					<p>
						<b>Docurizer</b> is a program which makes use of "Scopeifier" and <b>automatically creates human readable docs</b> with prettified source code.  It is significantly more advanced than any doc creating program I've ever seen in that <b>it does not use explicit instructions hidden in comments</b> to create docs, but instead pre-compiles the program and pulls the information from that.  If you want proof of its power, use web inspector to hover over elements in the source code view and see details which could only be known by a compiler.<br>
						<br>
						<b>Scopeifier</b> was also built by me, and it is a "Just In Time" all languages parser.  It uses Regular Expressions from a rule set file to define patterns in code.  Currently, the only rule set I've made is for C++, but it can very easily be used for any language at all.  The impetus for making "Scopeifier" was for me to have something that <b>can parse any code at runtime speeds</b> into it's constituent scopes (for loop, var name, type def, etc.) for either documentation purposes, IDE text highlighting, or as the first stage in code compilation.  The last of these three is part of a personal desire of mine to someday create a new language (codename: "Sol").

						<b>Robot Soul is an in browser DAW (Digital Audio Workstation)</b> personal project of mine.  It has movable devices with front and back ends.

The web page is quite simple but still very fun.  Mouse movement controls the text color for the page, a radial gradient behind a cut out logo, and when hovered over the eye, it animates the eye and deblurs the background.  The Artists Bios page includes a script which randomizes the order of members every page load.  Overall, <b>it's not that impressive of a website, but I enjoy it as an art piece</b>.

					<p>
						The Lullaby Interactive Sound Machine was the auditory aspect on the center piece of the Flipside Art Festival for 2016.  The fingernails of a massive wooden baby were all pressable, and triggered constantly progressing musical notes.  The notes were re-chosen every five seconds to be a new chord, or occasionally a new key, which gave the piece a beautifully progressive yet chaotic sound as participants played around with little regard for melody or rhythm.  The buttons also triggered flame throwers atop the Baby, occasionally starting a pattern which was generated by the Effigy Flame Effects Sequencer (project showcased further below).

						Digiden was the codename for a search engine site focused on public identities and payment addresses.  For this site I made a few fancy UI elements, namely the suggestion bar (currently defunct in demo), the drop-down menu, and switches.  In order to make the site workable without an Internet connection, it is designed to store all queries in local storage.  It even has the option to encrypt local storage using a tool for AES-EBC encryption I stitched together and called SAFE.js.

				<h2>PINE - (User Friendly Framework and Documentation, Asynchronous Data Structures, Html DOM)</h2>
				<div class="project_and_description">
					<imgArea><img src="public/images/PINE.png"></imgArea>
					<p>
						PINE is a UI framework I made in order to streamline the process of making special UI elements, especially ones which communicate or depend on the actions of others, without having issues with excessive event or mutation listeners.  It has become the only tool I use, replacing JQuery and AngularJs, and I really enjoy it.  That being said, I'm one person alone working on it, and I can not call this a business ready solution, but for personal projects it is amazing.  To explain it simply, it grows outwards from a set root point in stages, effecting page elements which match specified cases, and then it modifies those elements sometimes adding functions.  Each stage either depends on the completion of previous stages in parent elements or child elements, where some types of functionality grow from the root and others gather from the sub elements.  If you'd like to know more, please ask.  Proper GUI growing is a subject I'm very fond of.

						For this project I'm using Three.js, SketchUp, and Blender to make a small, scenic, 3d world.  So far it has realistic looking water, perlin noise generated hills, a beautiful skybox, randomly placed trees, some very rough physics emulation, and a little house with a door you can open and close.  The project is only barely started but the hope is that it will someday be the beautiful pine forest landscape I've always dreamed of living on.

				<h2>Black Lister - (Web Extensions)</h2>

					<imgArea><img src="public/images/black_lister_loop.gif"></imgArea>
					
					<p>
						I got really tired of w3schools coming up in my searches above MDN so I made a Firefox extension to "Blam" it.  It's a pretty straightforward extension, if you find a page you don't like, you open the extension and click the big red button to "Blam" it.  From then on, any external links to the page will be blurred out and desaturated.  In the other direction, if you really like a page, you can highlight it.  It's a very good tool for search engines.

						What started off as a simple way to test what a group of flame throwers would look like when triggered by buttons eventually evolved into an entire sequencing program which can import and export MIDI, and has its own propriety file extension for projects called a .feg (F E G == Effigy).  The program also has algorithms which can be combined with different patterns to create even crazier patterns.

				I like to do all of my projects from a blank file, using vanilla code.  The result is that whatever code is there, is the code I need, and no more.  Also, I learn a lot.  Obviously not all projects can (or should) be like this, but I still always do my best to find and pick whichever code base is most modular, and most to the point.

				<h2>Exploratory</h2>
				In order to keep myself and the things I make relevant, I always aim to focus on the future.  Often this means trying new things and being on the front of the technology adoption bell curve.  Obviously, backwards compatibility is crucial, but similarly, something that worked in the past might not really "work" today.
