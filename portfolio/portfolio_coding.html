				<h2>This Webpage - (Web Dev)</h2>
				Everything you see here was made <b>from scratch</b> using Javascript, CSS, HTML, SVG, PINE, SketchUp, Blender, Gimp, Three.js, Zepto (a thin JQuery), and Green Sock.  There was no templates of any sort used for this or anything else I ever make.  Also, this page is mobile friendly.  Try scaling your window!

				This is a deep one.  The spectrum of coding which went into this is very akin to creating ones own language.  On the surface, it is a functional html injector which allows users to define new html elements and attributes for the sake of serving new purposes.  It's similar to Google's AngularJs, but much less restrictive and with nicer syntax.  I've only just begun the product testing phase but it's already proving itself essential to my work flow.  Also, it appears to play very nice with old and lame browsers.

				For this project I'm using Three.js, SketchUp, and Blender to make a small, scenic, 3d world.  So far it has realistic looking water, perlin noise generated hills, a beautiful skybox, randomly placed trees, some very rough physics emulation, and a little house with a door you can open and close.  The project is only barely started but the hope is that it will someday be the beautiful pine forest landscape I've always dreamed of living on.<br>

				I got really tired of w3schools and about.com coming up in my searches so I made a chrome extension to "Blam" them.  Unfortunately, upon uploading the finished extension I got an email from Google saying that my developer account was suspended and all my extesions were taken down without any explanation as to why and with absolutely no extra information I might use to fix the situation.  Eventually (a week later) my account was re-instated, also without any explanation nor notification, but by that point I'd already sworn off using Google products as much as possible.  It was a lot like dieting.  At first is was kind of hard but, looking back, Google is not what they make themselves out to be and is actually kind of icky.  Anyways, the point is that I abandoned this project as a result but will eventually be porting it to Firefox.<br>

				My best friend is in school for interaction design and had to redesign a banking app.  The way students normally achieve this is by drawing out every single screen in Adobe Illustrator, which is kind of absurd when there are so many UI development tools in the world.  Eventually, I convinced her to let me translate her project into html/css.  The process took about a day, and that was for a working prototype.  The next day I went through and redesigned it for my own sake.  In the end, though, I realized that not everybody has time to learn html/css, and most companies don't really care how things are done (or know any better).<br>

				</div>
				What started off as a simple way to test what a group of flame throwers would look like when triggered by buttons eventually evolved into an entire sequencing program which can import and export MIDI, and has its own propriety file extension for projects called a .feg (F E G == Effigy).  The program also has algorithms which can be combined with different patterns to create even crazier patterns.  This year it will be premiering at a small festival called "Flipside," having been drowned out last year by torrential flooding.

		<columns class="image_blurb_group highlight_odds">
			<div bgImage="url('public/images/LoveOpenSource.png')">
				<h2>Open Source</h2>
				Too many great ideas have been thwarted by the closed source systems which inevitably fall into the wrong hands.  I don't want to spend my life creating ideas for a thing that I may some day be denied access from, nor do I wish to deny the world of the tools I create.
			</div>
			

			<div bgImage="url('public/images/NoBloat.png')">
				<h2 class="">No Bloat</h2>
				It's just a matter of cleanliness.  There are a lot of users and businesses that will slap together a few oversized libraries and consider it "working."  I prefer to have only the code that's needed, and not so much overhead.
			</div>


			<div bgImage="url('public/images/pioneer_icon.png')">
				<h2>Explorative</h2>
				In order to keep myself and the things I make relevant, I always aim to focus on the future.  Often this means trying new things and being on the front of the technology adoption bell curve.
				<!-- It's not exactly an ethic, but I'm much more enthused about the future than I am the past.  Certainly, many great things have been done, but rather than learning to recreate or emulate them, I prefer to get my hands dirty trying to explore the unexplored.  Pioneering, in a modern sense. -->
				<!-- Code is beautiful because it is an abstraction of the things we do into the fundamental logic behind them.  As code progresses, it reduces into purer forms in the way of updates and new features.  These progressments intrigue me and I intend to use and/or discover them. -->

			<div bgImage="url('public/images/html5-css3-js.png')">
				<h2>HTML 5, CSS 3, Javascript</h2>
				I've been working with HTML since age eleven, CSS the past six years, and Javascript the past four years. Javascript is one of my newest languages but it is also one of my favorites, mostly due to its portability and transparency.
			</div>

			<div bgImage="url('public/images/pine_logo.png')">
				<h2>PINE</h2>
				PINE is a tool I built myself for creating functional user interfaces.  At this point it has completely replaced JQuery and Angular Js in my personal projects, with astonishing results.
			</div>

		
			<div bgImage="url('public/images/zepto_icon.png')">
				<h2>Zepto (JQuery, JQuip)</h2>
				Zepto, JQuery, and JQuip are all plugins which help with dom traversal using the standard $('selecter') syntax. The only differences are that JQuery is really bloated, JQuip is the modular version of JQuery, and Zepto is built from scratch for the sake of being thin.  If you know one, you know all three.
			</div>

			<div bgImage="url('public/images/greensock_icon.png')">
				<h2>Green Sock Animations Plugin</h2>
				GSAP is a really powerful web animations plugin.  It's not Flash (thank heavens), but it can do a lot of flashy animations using some fancy css manipulations and a good bit of hardware acceleration.
			</div>

			<div bgImage="url('public/images/cordova_icon.png')">
				<h2>Cordova</h2>
				Cordova is the open source tool that Adobe copied, changed for the worse, and then pasted their name on as "PhoneGap."  It's a bridge between web design and phone apps (cameras, microphones, contact lists, ect.) that makes it easy to develop for all devices at the same time.
			</div>

			<div bgImage="url('public/images/mysql_icon.png')">
				<h2>MySQL</h2>
				MySQL is the database manager I'm most familiar with, but they're all fairly similar.  I've built a couple websites around big data dreams, and took an entire class once in SQL jedi-ism.
			</div>


			

			<div bgImage="url('public/images/three_icon.png')">
				<h2>Three.js</h2>
				Currently, this is my favorite new tool.  It's what I used to make the moving 3d logo at the top of the page and the "3d Walkscape" <a href='#walkscape'>showcased below</a>. In my opinion, Three.js is, without any doubt, the future of the web.  It's incredible.
			</div>
			


			<div bgImage="url('public/images/java_icon.png')">
				<h2>Java</h2>
				Java was my bread and butter for a long time, but I've since moved to Javascript for the sake of portability and easier UI control.
			</div>

			
			<div bgImage="url('public/images/pastcode_icon.png')">
				<h2>C++, Python, GoLang, AngularJs, PHP</h2>
				These are all languages and libraries I've worked with, but were not productive enough for me to create anything truly presentable.  I don't use them anymore, but I still know them fairly well.
			</div>


			<div bgImage="url('public/images/linux_unix.png')">
				<h2>Unix/Linux</h2>
				I work in OSX, but I've dabbled with a few Linux distrubutions as well.  Namely Ubuntu, Mint, and Raspian.  I liked them all and would have been content to call one of them my new OS (Mint), but there were a few essential things that I couldn't get running the way I like, and so I came back to OSX.  Some day, though, I'll have weened myself off of closed source companies for good.
