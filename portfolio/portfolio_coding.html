				<h2>Robot Soul - (Single Page Web App, Digital Audio Workstation, Js Audio Node)</h2>
				<div class="project_and_description">
					<img src="public/images/robot_soul_loop.gif">
					<p>
						Robot Soul is an in browser DAW (Digital Audio Workstation) personal project of mine.  It has movable devices with front and back ends.  The front end contains the knobs and general controls, while the back shows ports for input and output which can be connected to other devices.  Projects can be saved and loaded, and music can be played using the keyboard.  It's still in it's early stages, but I hope to someday use this as a high functioning performance tool.<br>

				<h2>Vision Gland Web Page - (Experimental Interactive Web Design)</h2>
				<div class="project_and_description">
					<img src="public/images/vision_gland_site.gif">
					<p>
						The Vision Gland project titled "The Vessel" was an immersive interaction and exploration art piece for which I was build lead and developed the web page.  The web page is quite simple but still very fun.  Mouse movement controls the text color for the page, a radial gradient behind a cut out logo, and when hovered over the eye, it animates the eye and deblurs the background.  The Artists Bios page includes a script which randomizes the order of members every page load.  It's not really that impressive of a site, but I enjoy it as an art piece.

				<h2>Lullaby Sound Interactive Machine - (Python, Raspberry Pi, Interactive Art, Music Theory, Audio Editing)</h2>
				<div class="project_and_description">
					<img src="public/images/flipside_baby.png">
					<p>
						The Lullaby Interactive Sound Machine was the auditory aspect on the center piece of the Flipside Art Festival for 2016.  The fingernails of a massive wooden baby were all pressable, and triggered constantly progressing musical notes.  The notes were re-chosen every five seconds to be a new chord, or occasionally a new key, which gave the piece a beautifully progressive yet chaotic sound as participants played around with little regard for melody or rhythm.  The buttons also triggered flame throwers atop the Baby, occasionally starting a pattern which was generated by the Effigy Flame Effects Sequencer (project showcased further below).

						The Stash Node was going to be the flagship product for a Crypto currency company called Stash, and this was the product page I designed for it.

						Digiden was the codename for a search engine site focused on public identities and payment addresses.  For this site I made a few fancy UI elements, namely the suggestion bar (currently defunct in demo), the drop-down menu, and switches.  In order to make the site workable without an Internet connection, it is designed to store all queries in local storage.  It even has the option to encrypt local storage using a tool for AES-EBC encryption I stitched together and called SAFE.js.

				<h2>PINE - (User Friendly Framework and Documentation, Asynchronous Data Structures, Html DOM)</h2>
				<div class="project_and_description">
					<img src="public/images/PINE.png">
					<p>
						PINE is a UI framework I made in order to streamline the process of making special UI elements, especially ones which communicate or depend on the actions of others, without having issues with excessive event or mutation listeners.  It has become the only tool I use, replacing JQuery and AngularJs, and I really enjoy it.  That being said, I'm one person alone working on it, and I can not call this a business ready solution, but for personal projects it is amazing.  To explain it simply, it grows outwards from a set root point in stages, effecting page elements which match specified cases, and then it modifies those elements sometimes adding functions.  Each stage either depends on the completion of previous stages in parent elements or child elements, where some types of functionality grow from the root and others gather from the sub elements.  If you'd like to know more, please ask.  Proper GUI growing is a subject I'm very fond of.

				<div class="project_and_description">
					<img src="public/images/3d_walkscape_loop.gif">
					<p>
						For this project I'm using Three.js, SketchUp, and Blender to make a small, scenic, 3d world.  So far it has realistic looking water, perlin noise generated hills, a beautiful skybox, randomly placed trees, some very rough physics emulation, and a little house with a door you can open and close.  The project is only barely started but the hope is that it will someday be the beautiful pine forest landscape I've always dreamed of living on.

				<h2>Black Lister - (Web Extensions)</h2>
				<div class="project_and_description">
					<img src="public/images/black_lister_loop.gif">
					
					<p>
						I got really tired of w3schools coming up in my searches above MDN so I made a Firefox extension to "Blam" it.  It's a pretty straightforward extension, if you find a page you don't like, you open the extension and click the big red button to "Blam" it.  From then on, any external links to the page will be blurred out and desaturated.  In the other direction, if you really like a page, you can highlight it.  It's a very good tool for search engines.

						What started off as a simple way to test what a group of flame throwers would look like when triggered by buttons eventually evolved into an entire sequencing program which can import and export MIDI, and has its own propriety file extension for projects called a .feg (F E G == Effigy).  The program also has algorithms which can be combined with different patterns to create even crazier patterns.

			</div>
			

			<div bgImgSrc="public/images/NoBloat.png">
				<h2 class="">No Bloat</h2>
				I like to do all of my projects from a blank file, using vanilla code.  The result is that whatever code is there, is the code I need, and no more.  Also, I learn a lot.  Obviously not all projects can (or should) be like this, but I still always do my best to find and pick whichever code base is most modular, and most to the point.
			</div>


			<div bgImgSrc="public/images/pioneer_icon.png">
				<h2>Exploratory</h2>
				In order to keep myself and the things I make relevant, I always aim to focus on the future.  Often this means trying new things and being on the front of the technology adoption bell curve.  Obviously, backwards compatibility is crucial, but similarly, something that worked in the past might not really "work" today.
			</div>

		

			<div bgImgSrc="public/images/sad_puppy.png">
				<h2>Humane</h2>
				The world is as hurt as it ever needed to be and some.  There aren't many things I'm unwilling to work with, but cruelty for profit one of them.  Moreover, if there is something I can be doing to make the world a better place, I will be far more self motivated than otherwise.

				<h2>HTML 5, CSS 3, Javascript</h2>
				I've been working with HTML since age eleven, CSS the past six years, and Javascript the past four years. Of all of these, Javascript is by far my favorite, and with the advent of Node.js, I rarely find a problem that can't be fixed with it.
			</div>

				<h2>Zepto (JQuery, JQuip)</h2>
				Zepto, JQuery, and JQuip are all plugins which help with dom traversal using the standard $('selecter syntax. The only differences are that JQuery is really bloated, JQuip is the modular version of JQuery, and Zepto is built from scratch for the sake of being thin.  If you know one, you know all three.

			<!-- <div bgImgSrc="public/images/cordova_icon.png">
				<h2>Cordova</h2>
				Cordova is the open source tool that Adobe copied, changed for the worse, and then pasted their name on as "PhoneGap."  It's a bridge between web design and phone apps (cameras, microphones, contact lists, ect.) that makes it easy to develop for all devices at the same time.
			</div> -->

			<div bgImgSrc="public/images/mysql_icon.png">

				MySQL is the database manager I'm most familiar with, but they're all fairly similar, and I have no allegiance to any one of them.  I've built a couple websites around big data dreams, and taken classes SQL jedi-ism.

			<div bgImgSrc="public/images/three_icon.png">

				<h2>C++, Python, GoLang, AngularJs, PHP</h2>
				These are all languages and libraries which fall somewhere in between me having learned them, and me having chose them for a long term project.  C++ has gotten significantly more of my time than the others having been the code my college chose for teaching, but I still only ever used it for many short term assignments.

				I work in OSX, but I've dabbled with a few Linux distributions as well.  Namely Ubuntu, Mint, and Raspian.  I liked them all and would have been content to call one of them my new OS (Mint), but there were a few essential things that I couldn't get running the way I like (multi-touch gestures), and so I came back to OSX.
