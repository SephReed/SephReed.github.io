			<h2>The Space Crawl, Silver Room &amp; Ballpit Slide</h2>
			<imagewrap><img src="public/images/in_space.gif"></imagewrap>
			<p>
				The "Space Crawl" was a section of an art piece called "The Vessel" which was an interactive/exploratory building.  The space crawl was usually one of the last rooms to be found as it was a small crawl space hidden behind a painting of space.  The inside of the room was lit with black light and painted to look like outer space, planets, and stars and played a <a href="https://soundcloud.com/thumbz/space-crawl">15 minute ambient song</a> I made on loop.  At the end of space crawl was a slide that went into a ballpit, and hidden behind one of the walls was yet another secret passageway to a room called "The Escape Pod."  It was designed and built by <a href="http://misty.nationbuilder.com">Misty Nickle</a> and I.  To see images of it all, click "view gallery" below.<br>

			<h2>Flipside 2017 Effigy</h2>
			<imagewrap><img src="public/images/galleries/effigy/playwood_loop3.gif"></imagewrap>
			<p>
				This is the biggest and most involved project I've ever done.  It's an 800 square foot, three floored structure, filled with themed rooms, and it will be the center piece for a large local event called "Flipside" which ends with it being lit ablaze.  I'm working with <a href="http://misty.nationbuilder.com">Misty Nickle</a> for this project and we're leading a volunteer team of mostly newbies in building, disassembling, transporting, and reassembling the entire thing in about 30 half work days.  We've done all the designing, budgeting, and organizing, and it is going great!  To see some progress images, click "View Gallery" below.  You can also see <a href="http://sephreed.github.io/DaFT_2017/index.html">the project page</a> if you're interested in its inspiration or organization.<br>

			<h2>Handmade Furnishings</h2>
			<imagewrap><img src="public/images/galleries/wood_work/loop.gif"></imagewrap>
			<p>
				Whenever I need furniture, I get out my tools.  In the image above is a loft bed, book shelf, work desk, wall shelving, and a dinner table (made on commission).  I have many other things I've built in my home, but these do a good job of showing my overall aesthetic.

			<h2>Metal Work</h2>
			<imagewrap><img src="public/images/galleries/metal_work/metalwork.gif"></imagewrap>
			<p>
				All the above projects were a result of a introductory welding class I took.  In the class I learned how to do MIG and oxyacetylene welding, along with plasma cutting, pipe bending, sand blasting, and many other things.  I've since learned some black smithing and stick welding.  My favorite welding style is oxyacetylene because I like doing small precision pieces.

			<h2>Cedar Deck</h2>
			<imagewrap><img src="public/images/galleries/cedar_deck/cedar_deck.gif"></imagewrap>
			<p>
				One of my part time jobs is as an assistant/apprentice to a very skilled carpenter named Daniel Jost.  This is one of the many projects I've worked on with him.  Prior to our arrival, there was a deck about half the size of the one shown that was badly slanted, falling off the side of the house, and had a very dated railing.
