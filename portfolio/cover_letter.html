					<center><h3>Who I am</h3></center>
					
					&nbsp;&nbsp;Here's a few of my qualities: empathy, experience, drive, and like a smidge of humor.<br>
					&nbsp;&nbsp;Empathy being more than a simple reflection of those around you, it is the ability to hear a story and fill all the characters shoes, searching for the misunderstandings. It is the cornerstone of human centered design and ethics.<br>
					&nbsp;&nbsp;Skill is something better shown than said.  If you would like to judge mine for yourself, see my portfolio, and take note that every project was made from 100% scratch.  The code contains no external libraries, the sound designs don't use presets, the physical builds aren't from tutorials, and the image assets are never stock.<br>
					&nbsp;&nbsp;As for humor, it is the Ying to stress's Yang.  It's very serious to me that people not be too serious.  Seriously.  Things are going to be okay, and let's all have a laugh.<br>
					&nbsp;&nbsp;And finally, real talk, of all metrics of personal success I can express, to me the most involved and complex is that I manage to be content and laugh and joke and care while simultaneously being aware of just how much corruption exists, and how truly and utterly quelled most of our dreams are.  To me, that is a success that even the most intelligent rarely accomplish.


						<!-- There is much left in the world to improve, and the path to such goals is built one block at a time with empathy, experience, drive, and fair bit of good humor.
						To some people, empathy is defined as simply resonating with the feelings of others.  But to me, it is much the opposite.  Rarely does a persons problem include no other players, and to strongly feel any one emotion is to have already picked a side.  The way I see empathy is as a quiet mind playing out the characters and looking for the misunderstanding.  This is probably one of the most important skills a person can have in relation to both teamwork and user centered design.
						As for experience, I started programming when I was ten, and have been working with computers my whole life as well as more physical building components, instruments, arts, writing, and just everything I've ever found interesting.  But for something like this, I think actions speak louder than words.  There's plenty of projects to view on my portfolio, and every one of them was made 100% from scratch.  I aim to learn everything I can, so my code contains no external libraries, my sound designs don't use presets, my builds aren't from tutorials, and my image assets are never stock.  Unless I know I can do something entirely from scratch, I don't feel comfortable saying it's something I can do. 
						And as for the lols, they're crucial to me. They're pretty much the ying of stress's yang, the release valve on ambitious overload.  Seriously, it's really, really super serious that things not be so damn serious all the time.  Or something like that.  The point here is simply that I'm not some robot who identifies purely as a list of accomplishments, but some guy who likes to joke around and just so happens to not be content unless something is getting done.  I need that sensation of "progress" like a meth head needs meth.

						But of all metrics of success I can express, to me the most involved and complex is that I manage to be content and laugh and joke and care while simultaneously being aware of just how much darkness exists, and how truly and utterly fucked humanity is on an ethical level.  To me, that is a success that even the most intelligent rarely accomplish. -->
