The Road Untraveled


For the first half the writer starts from an omniscient perspective which has an overly set up scene, implying fiction, in which two paths being equal is noted.  Then, somewhere towards the end, the perspective changes to a theoretical first hand account in which he regards the path he chose as being different (specifically in a way that satarizes american culture).  

The thing which is strange about this is that until he theorizes he would say that one is different, it is not fully implied that he realizes the two are the same.  It is only through acknowledging that he is the writer of the first part, and not just the subject, that his awareness of their equality is implied.  One might, and likely would, just as easily read through without realizing that he knew the two paths were the same and that it was a truth only available from the omniscient perspective, though this is mostly due to our instict to empathize with the character as the story is going, rather than the character who is currently telling their story.  In other words, it would be strange to listen to a sober man talk about being drunk, and think of the story as being sober.

This is the mind fuck of it though.  At the moment the writer projects into the future with less knowledge than he has already shown of the past, a fallacy is born, which pulls us out of the narative and into the meta (what we know about the writer) and consequently implies the opposite of what is said.

It is not that the opposite of what is said was not already said, but that our empathetic place in the narrative does not arrive at that opposite until the narrative is broken and we are forced to look at the writer not as a character but a person who must actually make sense.
