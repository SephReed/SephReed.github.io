If you want to learn to do something (brain with face reaching towards "cool new trick"), the first step is to do it wrong (same brain with a tiny stepping stool).  That's why I'm making this video (arrows pointing everywhere), so I can learn to make videos (screencap of workflow).  Obviously I'm going to do things wrong (screencap of bad workflow), and that's okay.  I'm supposed to, (big thumbs up) that's how you learn what you do and don't like (check list).  And, amazingly, in this digital age, you can always go back and change things (tardis).

So, if there is something you feel like you've been wanting to do, in the words of some famous celebrity I really only recognize from Holes, do it.  And in particular, do it wrong.  Maybe even set out to prove to yourself you can't do it, and do it wrong on accident on purpose.  But whatever you do, don't not fail to do it.
