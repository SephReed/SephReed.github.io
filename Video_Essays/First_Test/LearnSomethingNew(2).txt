 If you want to learn something new, the frist step is to do it wrong.  That is both the premise, and the impetus of this video.

I want to know how to make videos, and so here I am, following in the foot steps of every great creator, and fucking it up.  Witness as I, like the great Leonardo Davinci, spend hours of working making little to no progress.  Watch, as like Lance Armstrong falling off his bike, my first video will be little more a cascade of mistakes.  And envy as I present my the product of all my efforts, only for it to be of little to no consequence to anybody.

But perhaps envy does not suit you?  Well, in that case, you can follow the greats of long ago with me, and the first step is to think of something you want to be able to do and then do it wrong.
