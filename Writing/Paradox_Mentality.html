Let's begin with a simple example of what a quatum state might be like.  What is -1 to the infite power (-1^inf)?  Well, if we try doing -1 * -1 * -1 * -1... the answer seems to be bouncing between -1 and 1, so it's probably one of those two.  But it can't be both at the same time, nor can it be a mix, nor would it really make sense for it to be one or the other.

This is, in very few words, one of the simplest ways of seeing a quantum state: it is a set of answers that can not be mixed or held simultaneously, but are the only possible answers, with no way of proving one over the other.  The paradox mentality is the mental state of believing multiple inherently conflicting things to be true at the same time.
