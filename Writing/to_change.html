					There is much left in the world to improve, and the path to such goals is built one block at a time with intelligence, drive, and empathy.  This path is humanities project, an endeavor to create a world more suited for as many parts of us as can be reconciled at once.  Often times the best way forward is to simply try to keep things fun, to not let momentum fade.  Other times things are more grim, fun can't fix everything, and it's okay for things to stop or slow from time to time.  But in all things, there is a choice: to keep your mind engaged and play the game, or to follow habits and instict and take the ride.  And the place where this choice lies is something I consider very important.
					Life would be a drag if one were to never go with the flow.  But, riding the hype train is probably the #1 cause of all problems in humanity, so when to abandon ship is equally important as when to jump aboard.  In short, it's important to have fun, but it's also important to avoid mistakes, especially when you aren't going to be the one to pay for them.
