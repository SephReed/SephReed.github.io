She said I'm sorry I can't baby you
know that I'm crazy do
you maybe hate me too?
No just don't play me a fool

I've got to do my own thang, 
like I know we both can,
wasn't that part of the plan?
Yeah, but then they all just wanted

Yoouuuuuuu, they just wanted you.
They all just wanted, 
Yoouuuuuuu, not me, they only wanted you.

And looking back, I should have known better,
we were never soulmates we just stuck together,
be as it may she made me light as a feather,
it was never her job to guide me through stormy weather.

It's just I had wanted it so bad,
and who am I kidding she was the best I'd ever had,
I only regret being blinded sad and
missing my chance to reach out.

Ahhhh, ahhhhhh, ahhhh, ahhhhhh.

But it's been a while now and I'm doing much better,
even though I still will never forget her.
Still wonder why it had to be like this and
still wonder if I'll ever feel bliss again.

But if I could, I'm not sure I would.
Best thing I ever felt but it wasn't good.
Like a bad drug, it drove me insane,
tore my life apart, caused me great pain.

Broken emotions the just cut so deep,
traumatized inner child, I can hear it's soul weep,
Strong on the outside, I let it sleep,
I've got my whole life to make ends meet.

But I'll still never forget the feeling when...

They all just wanted, 
Yoouuuuuuu, they just wanted you.
They all just wanted, 
Yoouuuuuuu, not me, they only wanted you.

They all just wanted, 
Yoouuuuuuu, they just wanted you.
They all just wanted, 
Yoouuuuuuu, not me, just you.
