**Description:** A safe place of sanity, where people can quit trying to pretend they're holier than though (even if they are) and just admit that humanity is broken from the bottom up and that includes each and every one of us.  No system will fix this, no president, no movement.  We have different opinions, that's okay.  You're okay.  We're okay. Even if we're monsters.



---------------------------------
**Rules/Bannable Offenses:**
---------------------------------

**Overview:** This is meant to be something of a safe space, not in the sense that we can't outright state our horribly monstrous self-righteous opinions, but in the sense that there is no right or wrong, except to lie or argue without making it apparent you know you're being a dick.

**Having unintentional arguments:**
>*tl;dr We're all monsters every day, the least we could do is disengage from fighting once in a while, or at least make it apparent we know we are.*  
> If you're going to argue, you have to preface it with this text exactly: **"I THINK I'M BETTER THAN OTHER PEOPLE AND WILL NOW ATTEMPT TO FORCE MY VIEWS ON TO OTHERS."**  Beyond this initial statement, feel free to argue as much as you want.  Prior to this statement, anything that crosses the line from curious discussion to aggressive debate will get you kicked.  In short: instead of telling people what you think, ask what they think.  If you can lead them to their own fallacy without being a dick about it, fine.  If you're someone being asked leading questions, feel free to say you just feel like having your own equally shitty opinion, and call **"TRUCE."**  All "TRUCE" must be respected.

**Anti Advertisement/Pop Culture safe space**

> Don't shill here, don't make a new thread about some pop culture bull shit that's happening at the moment.  If you really want to talk about some pop culture garbage, check the "Weekly Trash Hole" post for a thread about it.  But seriously, outside of the trash hole, don't post about whatever stupid hashtag is already trending literally everywhere on the internet.  We're being brainwashed into thinking this stuff matters enough as it is, this one space is meant to be safe.  Alternatively, **instead of posting and talking about a topic everyone else is, post about things you find interesting.**  Literally anything.  Many of us just want to have an honest conversation about something that's somewhat interesting, instead of the constant over-hyped positive/negative hysteria that's so ubiquitous.

**Be yourself, speak directly**

>If you want to play a character, preface it with **"AS CHARACTER [desc]"**.  It's fun to play characters online, but it can also be an obnoxious facade for everyone else trying to figure out if you're being real/honest or not.  So, if you're trying to play, just state it early.  Tell people what character you're playing, and perhaps they'll join in.  Similarly, sarcasm is extra work for people.  If you're being sarcastic, please don't.  But if you absolutely must to be yourself, add the **"/s"**.  






Don't shill, don't post about pop culture trending crap, don't be aggressive with your text, and admit it: you're the same shitty beast as everyone else on the inside.
