Livining in every breath,
I never see you pass me by,
The weight I once would heft
is not a loss, but yet I cry.

Don't think twice, the thoughts not good enough
try tough, try love, it can't be should enough
and set the satin silky skin aside
tonight I want to know you eye to eye.

Don't try to take what's mine
this life's to short, I'll pay no fine
for things you wanted but could not make
they simply are not yours to take

it was an effort, I'll admit,
that time didn't leave it's mark again
and as you throw your little fit
I smile and think I'm me and gain

because there's growth in every stand
and life is made to be strung of moments
precious little great they land
like snowflakes rare and heavy sonnets

we write the music to make it true
we script the stories to kill the blue
we'll never stop for it's our dues
back to the universes oftless whims

I give nothing back to those who only take
this life is only ours to make
it's been a blast, I'm having fun
and when all is said and done

I'll be going strong and old
making jokes, not being told
to be something else because it's to late
just as now, forever fate.
