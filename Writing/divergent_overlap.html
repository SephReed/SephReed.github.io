The Divergent Overlap Ideal:

Divergent - we're all separate, with unique goals, and ultimately different paths.
Overlap - for all our differences, there are still many ways we can help each other out.

How to do it:
1.  Converse with other groups about what can be shared.
2.  Share things (ie extra resources, lessons learned, compassion).
3.  Make some attempt to plan for and around overlap, for the sake of pooling resources.
4.  Give credit where it is due.  If something is shared with you, let it be known.




In Detail:
Talk to central contacts in as many groups similar to yorus as possible.
