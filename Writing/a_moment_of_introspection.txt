I don't think much anymore, and I like that.  It's a welcomed change, I let it whole heartedly, the amazing sensation of not hating my own life.  I know, and knew, and know yet that it will corrode.   Like water on steel, slowly, deeper and deeper, I will become hollow.  Except anger: somehow it never leaves.  

I do enjoy this life I'm living.  I see I'm fortunate.  But man, it still isn't really making much ground against what I've already lost.  Still, it's not getting worse.  I guess that's all there is to say.
