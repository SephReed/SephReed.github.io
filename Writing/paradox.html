<p>tl;dr:  it is unlikely that one has out thought evolution and millenia of wild human behaivour.</p>
<p>Often times logical people will hear this advice "don't over think it."  This advice is bull shit.  Thinking is one of the greatest gifts in life and "over thinking" is never the problem.  Sometimes over stressing can be a problem but even stress has its virtues and many, many great innovators have been people of stress.  Also, once you "over think" a thing, there's not really any off switch that reverses the process.  Or is there?</p>
<p>Well, no.  But most learing processes do have a boomerang effect which is similar.  Very often, the simplest answer is the best answer but for very complex reasons.  Those who don't "over think" simply choose the simplest answer, while those who do wander off in search of an explanation.  Along the way, it is common for thinkers to find some other more complex answer and glom on for the sake of proving their superiority, but if you continue to evolve your answer it will eventually reach a point where it's surface resembles the simplest answers.  In many ways this is infuriating because simple minds achieve something similar much quicker but it is also very assuring in other ways.</p>
<p>First, of all, simple minds choose the paths made most obvious through evolution.  To come to the same conclusion as evolution is no simple matter, even if taking it's paths comes instinctually.  Secondly, convergence of thought between ultra complex evaluation and simple instinct is extremely satisfying if you aren't picking sides.  Thirdly, once you start to see this pattern over and over, you can feel okay with having not yet thought everything through.  Your first impulses are very good placeholders for your final decision and any large variation between the two is more likely to indicate an incomplete process than a complete one.</p>

<p>So where does this process turn around?  How can something progress through complexity and end up back at simplicity?</p>
<p>Well, eventually it reaches a mind boggling point where it doesn't make sense.</p>

    Meeseeks 2: OKAY, JERRY, YOU GOT TO JUST CHOKE UP ON THE CLUB!!!<br>
    Jerry: WELL, WHICH IS IT!?! Choke up or follow-through!?!<br>
    Meeseeks 1: OH, COME ON, JERRY!! WE'VE BEEN OVER THIS!! YOU KNOW YOU GOT TO DO BOTH!!<br>
    Meeseeks 2: THIS IS AS FRUSTRATING FOR US AS IT IS FOR YOU!!<br>
    Jerry: Don't tell me that! That just puts pressure on me!!<br>
    Meeseeks 1: JUST TRY TO RELAX!!<br>
    Jerry: YOU TRY TO RELAX!!! HAVE YOU EVER TRIED TO RELAX!?! IT IS A PARADOX!!!<br>

<p> The above is a quote from "Rick and Morty" -- a wonderful show -- and it exemplifies one of the very many types of advice I personally have heard more times than I count.  Another great one is "stop trying."</p>
<p> All of these pieces of advice present an impossible challange to logic.  They are paradoxs, they make no sense if taken at face value and are often dismissed as "dumb and illogical."  Learning to handle them is one of the greatest mental feats I've ever acheived and has completely changed my perspective to something that has a feeling best conveyed in the term "four dimensional."  It is a befuddling and ingraspable sense of logic and often feels like a working conversation between logic and creativity.  It comes with benefits and a price.  The benefit is that impossibilities feel like conclusions, the price is that x vs y thinking becomems benign.  When thinking of x and y as the same thing, having let go of the concept of opposites as anything more than a thinking tool, many conversations will start to show an inherent flaw that is extremely hard to grasp.  In short, two warring nations praying to the same god does not make sense but neither party thinks like that.</p>



<p>First, an example.  Balance is a word often thrown around by people who are way out in left field.  Many times people will bring it up as they go from one over correction to another, always patting themselves on the back for having noticed their lean and chosen to counter it.  So what is the focal point of balance that all these people share?  Obviously, non existant.  Every person has their own definition of center, and this is fine, but it's not a good use of the word "balance."</p>
<p>Small digression, for a while I used to hate the word balance because it made no sense.  My new sacred word became "maintanence" because it made more sense.  In reality, that's all that people are doing when they "balance" themselves.  They're performing self maintanence and pretending it's something pure.</p>
<p>Anyways, balance is very different from maintanence.  If you watch a sober person standing, they do not lean from side to side.  They aren't in a constant state of watching themselves fall, getting scared, and catching themselves.  Standing is done by a further back part of the mind which does not cause stress.  Nor does it truly aim to "balance," it simply aims to counter all horizontal movement.  There is no opposing sides, no tipping scale.  If movement happens, stop it through movement.  It's goal is to create no movement through millions of tiny movements, and whether or not this would make sense if presented logically is inconsequential.  This example may seem stupid but that's because it's so simple to see that the abstractions our mind percieve are different from the reality of them.  It's two different types of movement that oppose.  It's made up of balancing forces and unbalancing forces.  And of course, unbalancing forces are a balancing force for balancing forces.... huh?</p>
<p>And yet you stand.  None of these strange abstractions of logic make any difference.</p>
<p>So let's try again, a little more refined.  Human balance is a balancing force in oppostion to universal unbalancing forces.  It makes order of chaos.  But chaos too is an illusion as all universal forces follow universal laws and everything is in a place for explainable reasons (to a point).  What we call "chaos" is really just a super complex order... So human balance creates a simplicity out of complexity... by adding more complexity?   No...</p>
<p>One more time.  Human balance is a network of responses which aim to keep a person from falling over.  Much less idealized, straight forward, simple.  To me this is true.  But it's not very much like the "balance" that we all know.  It's much more like "human vertical stance maitanence."</p>
<p>So if balancing itself is not really an example of what we think of as balance, where on earth did the notion of "balance" come from?</p>
<p>My guess is that when you see a toddler leaning from side to side, or two armies fighting, or a wieght and a pile of rice on a scale, or an equation, or your billionth conversation about fairness, the notion starts to seem like the most important thing in the world.  The toddler leans many directions, indifferent to them.  The armies soldiers and generals all have different ideals.  The scale has friction, wind, and a bounce all in play.  Equations are not "balanced," they are the same thing said twice.  And life isn't fair.  Balance is a moot point and believing in it makes it impossible to grasp your internal paradox.</p>



<p>Giving up on the world and betting on the worst</p>




<p> Solving a paradox</p>
<p>So here it comes.  The part where I either seem crazy or genius.  How do you solve a paradox?</p>
<p>You don't.  If you thought there was a way, you're still missing the point that there is no point.  Paradoxes are a solution to their own problem.  If they were one or the other, they would not be a paradox.</p>
<p>Thought is infinite, what else could be a conclusion to the infite but a paradox?  What else could have meaning in a meaningless universe?  Be good and evil, order and chaos, life and death?  Somehow all of these things came from one place, and to one place they will return.  That place is beyond our conception and the only grasp we have on it is this confusion of a term called "paradox."  It doesn't make sense, and how could it?</p>
<p>A question like "where does the universe come from" can never be answered because it's turtles all the way down.  And it implies a fault in the question.  However it is that the universe exists, it's not in a parent make child way.</p>


<p>Application</p>
<p>Say you're trying to be cool, but acting cool is the least cool thing to do, so you act cool by not acting cool.  The loop keeps going and does no good.  Any action you do will immedaitely make you less cool.  So what do you do?  Act cool.  You're going to do it no matter what.  There's nothing you can do to stop yourself.  And what people are saying when they say "don't act cool, be yourself" is not to "act like yourself."  They mean it literally, do what you're going to do and don't get mixed up over what you should or shouldn't do.  If you're uncool, the coolest thing you can do is be uncool because anything else would be trying.  The hard part of all of this is learning to want to fail.  Learning to want your mind to do nothing for you and your actions to be their own.  Letting yourself fall into yourself.</p>
<p>Now is the time I should say.  This will not make you cool.  It'll just stop you from making yourself less cool.  Being cool is a stupid thing to care about, it's based off of a persons ability to exist in the center of trends and social bell curves.  It requires chasing around meaningless fads trying to be king of the hill.  If you really want to do this with your life, follow the social media around the group you wish to join religiously.</p>
<p>Now do the first thing mentioned knowing it won't make you cool.  It's fucking hard to master but you should be choosing the former believing only the latter would work and be no more invested in your correctness than your anti-correctness.  If you're wrong, you'll end up being cool.  If you're right you're right.
