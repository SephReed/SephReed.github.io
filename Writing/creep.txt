I don't like the word creep.  It's basically insult to injury.


When a person is treated badly by those they put trust in, they have two choices: give up on people, or keep enduring.  Those who keep enduring will be put through the gauntlet until... someone is nice to them.  At that point their desire for human connection will attempt to create a bond, feeling as though they are the odd ones out.  

If the person who was kind is used to having people be kind to them (ie a pretty girl), and does not so much choose to be kind as is benefitted by it, that is to say: they do not endure to be kind, then this attachment will neither make sense nor be tolerated.  They does not see a connection between odd ones out, but an odd one out and someone who is treated better for whatever reason.  The common response is for the kind out of self benefit person to see the kind out of sheer will person as a creep, thus adding insult to injury.

To call a person creepy for becoming attached is to simply say "Haha, you thought I was nice, but I'm really just manipulative and you're a fool for thinking anyone else is kind by will."
