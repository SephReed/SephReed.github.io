	<h1>New DaFTee Training Checklist</h1>

	<h2>Checking Boards</h2>

	<p> Throughout this manual, there are 2x4's referred to as "#1 2x4", #"2 2x4", and "#3 2x4."  These numbers are their ratings in terms of straightness and squareness.  Number ones (#1) should be as straight as possible with no large chunks missing, and will be used primarily for the verticle legs which hold up each arch.  Number twos (#2) can be warped and chunky, but should not be totally fucked up.  Number threes (#3) are just a total mess of a board.  Get it together #3's.
	<br>
	<br>
	<b>To check a board:</b> put your eye on one end and look down the board.  Flip it a couple times.  After a dozen or so boards, it get's really obvious what's normal.</p>
