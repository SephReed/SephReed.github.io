	<h1>DaFT 2017 Rules</h1>

	<rule>
		<h2>1. Personal Boundaries and Consent</h2>
		<small>tl;dr : If a person is bothering you, you can set up a boundary to stop them as long as it's reasonable.</small>
		<p>People join DaFT for many reasons.  Some DaFTies are here for social contact.  But, some might just want to build and prefer to be left alone at times, sometimes by specific people, sometimes in specific ways.  This rule revolves around the procedure for such cases:<br>
		<br>
		<u>Boundaries</u> - are made on a person-to-person level. <br>
		<u>Consent</u> - is something you should ask for.  When in doubt as to whether or not what you're planning to do is wanted, ask.  For instance:  "Are you a hug person?"  "Are you busy right now?"  "Do you want me to show you how I do that?" "May I take your picture?"<br>
		<br>
		<b>Some examples of boundaries a person might set between themselves and another are:</b></p>

		<ul>
			<li>Touching</li>
			<li>Photography</li>
			<li>Flirting</li>
			<li>Chit Chat/Joking Around</li>
			<li>Puzzle Ruining - Being told how to do something while figuring it out</li>
			<!-- <li>Insulting Sarcastically</li> -->
		</ul>


		<p>For the most part, it's pretty easy to tell where a person's boundaries are via social cues, but if someone is not recognizing the cues you're giving, please find a clearer way to express them.  If they keep bothering you even after you've made it clear that they are, please come talk to us.</p>

		<h2>2. Booze/Saw Divide</h2>
		<small>tl;dr : If there is booze in your mouth, be out of reach of your saw.</small>
		<p>Drinking is totally fine, but please set booze/beer away from you whenever you're operating a saw.  We know that many of you have been drinking while cutting for years but figuring out who's safe to do that and who's not would be a constant job.  The factors would be how much they've drank and how experienced they are, but keeping track of all that is a task nobody wants.  So the rule is to keep a physical divide between drinking and cutting.  As in, the saw is not in reach while booze is in mouth.</p>
