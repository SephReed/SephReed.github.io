<page>There was once two best friends who loved everything sweet, soft, and lovely.  But of all the things they loved, rainbows and unicorns they loved most.</page>

<page>One day, a person with pointy shoulders and a black suit asked: "Which is better, rainbows or unicorns" to the two best friends.
<br>
"Well, what a silly questions the friends thought, the answer is so obvious."  And so they both answered at the time.  But instead of saying the same thing, one friend said "Unicorns" and the other said "Rainbows."</page>

<page>The two friends looked at each other in astonishment for a moment, before deciding surely it must be a mistake.  But when the friend who liked unicorns asked the friend who likes rainbows if they meant to say unicorns, they did not.  And when the friend who liked rainbows asked the friend who liked unicorns if they meant to say rainbows, they said "no, I like unicorns more."
<br>
So the they asked each other, "why don't you like what I like, it is so obvious that mine is better."</page>

<page>First the friend who liked rainbows spoke.  They said "I like rainbows because they're pretty, and have so many colors"  So other friend responded "I think rainbows colors are pretty, but I still think unicorns are prettier because they are pure white, and they have actual magic."

"Well, I guess it's okay that you like the white of a unicorn more than the colors of a rainbow, but I still think rainbows are cooler because you actually get to see them in real life"</page>

<page>But this is while the friends agreed it was okay to like different colors, they could not agree on whether unicorns being magical creatures we never get too see or rainbows being real things we get to see when we're lucky made one better than the other.  And so the debate turned into an argument, no longer about rainbows and unicorns, but about unseen magic and seen things.</page>

<page>
"Magical things are better because they are more powerful, and even if I haven't ever seen a unicorn, I know if I believe enough, some day I will."

"Realistic things are better because we can prove they aren't made up, and count on them to be there."

"I like believing in wonderful things!"

"Well, I like believing in real ones"
</page>

<page>
And so the friends argued for some time, until they eventually realized that maybe they should hang out with different people more.  So the friend who liked magic gravitated towards the people who all agreed that believing in magic was best.  And the friend who liked to know stuck with the people that agreed with them.

<page>
And as they grew up, they separated until they knew each other no more.  And somehow, so quickly, they both forgot that once upon a time, they enjoyed both the magic of unicorns and the presence of rainbows.  That until the black suit came and asked them that divisive question "which do you like more, to believe or to know," they were okay with both learning the things they could know, and believing the things they enjoyed.
<br>
Eventually, this separation grew so strong, that one friend would accept nothing but a dismal reality, and the other wanted nothing but to pretend things were great.  And they no longer saw each other as friends, but as enemies.
<br>
But when they went to bed, they would still go find each other in the dreamworld, and set aside their differences to be friends again, because at least in the dreamworld they knew it doesn't really matter if something is real or not, what matters is being friends, especially with those who's eyes see the things yours do not.
