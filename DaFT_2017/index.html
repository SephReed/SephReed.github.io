	<b>To all who want to help or learn...</b> <br>
	...this <i>Playwood Palace</i> has been designed to be very approachable for beginners and skilled alike.  If you've been on the fence about joining DaFT, would like to get some tips and safety training on tools, are feeling like you need to let out a little aggression into some wood, aren't really into it but have friends that seem like they'd love this, have been off DaFT awhile and kinda miss it, think that maybe you might be able to impress that special someone, whatever it may be, we want all the help we can get.  Creativity is welcome, or if it's more your style that day, you can mindlessly cut hundreds of the same size board.  Just don't be afraid to show up and ask how you can help.  We will have people meandering about who's first priority is to welcome newbies with a little training, some safety necessities, and an approachable task.<br>
	<br>
	<b>To all DaFTies...</b> <br>
	...welcome back suckers!  We're looking forward to spending some quality time in the upcoming months with all of you. :) <br>
	This year, as you may have noticed from the above paragraph, we're hoping to put a little extra energy into welcoming and training new people.  The Playwood Palace is a simple build in terms of skill but not in terms of size.  To give some perspective, the board count for 2x4's is just over 1,300 if everything goes perfectly.  Which it absolutely will not.  So, more hands makes lighter work, the plan is to reach out, get help, and make friends with some new gems.  Also, I'm very aware of how exhausted many of you are and would not be helping if I dumped this entire thing on the crew as is.  Anyway, if any of you are interested in helping teach the bread and butter of DaFT (chop saw and impact driver), or willing to gather a few people and take on one of the ~16 modules, or have a super cool idea that might work well with this project, please let Misty and I know and we'll do our best to make sure hands and minds are made available to you.  Also, if you have any friends or anyone who you think could benefit from DaFT, this should be a good year for them to get started.  And please, if at any point it seems like something gross is happening, don't hold it in.  Though we may be too preoccupied to notice, Misty and I both recognize that by doing an outreach there is potential for displacement, and we want absolutely none of that.  

	<br><br>Love and Rainbows My Little DaFTies!

	<h2 id="features">Planned Features</h2>
	<ul>
		<li><b>Slide</b>: 16ft drop over 28 ft span.  Siding and slide made from luan board (very smooth) with all lips going with downward movement and never against.  Made to <a href="http://www.michigan.gov/documents/dhs/Handbook_for_Public_Safety_CPSC_PUB-325_241534_7.pdf">these playground specs</a></li>

		<li><b>Pulley system</b>:  simple hook pulley system for passing potato sacks and other random shit from the ground to the 1st and 2nd floors and back.</li>

		<li><b>Hidden Space Room</b>:  8ft by 8ft hidden room, accessed through a 4ft tunnel.  Hidden room will be sealed from rain and light, with the interior painted black and muraled to look like space.  It will be black lit and also have mini projectors which will animate a moving galaxy on the ceiling.</li>

		<li><b>Ball Pit</b> : There will be a secret ball pit.  If I tell you where it is, you won't get to experience the joy of finding it yourself.</li>

		<li><b>Chalkboard wall</b>:  Upon entry, one of the first things people will see is a 8ft by 8ft chalk board wall.  There will be plenty of chalk as well</li>

		<li><b>Lost Forest Mirror maze</b>:  The bottom floor will be a maze.  Much of it will be covered in Mylar, and part of it will be decorated to look vaguely like a forest.</li>

		<li><b>Towers</b>:  You can stand in them and look cool.</li>

		<li><b>Flame Turrets</b>:  The turrets will have aimable flame throwers.  For safety.</li>

		<li><b>Calming Sounds</b>:  The auditory theme for this build will be heavenly.  Soft harp and strings sounds, with perhaps some falling water and bird songs.  Speakers will be placed throughout the building.</li>

		<li><b>Rainbow Lighting</b>: The lighting at night will be mostly LED strips, with a few color changing bulbs for each of the towers.  The rainbow colors have been very specifically chosen to not be the standard ones, while still close enough to look like a spectrum.  The lighting will move slowly and as fluidly as possible.</li>

		<li><b>Mini Living Rooms</b>:  Throughout the build are many plywood couches.  They are designed to have a nice backwards lean and sunken ass.  On the sides of some of them will be little tables, and in front of the will be little coffee tables.  The intention is to make people feel welcome and comfortable in the space.</li>

		<li><b>Big steps</b>:  The steps are designed to be bigger than average for the sake of making participants feel small again.  The deeper theme of this build is inner child, and by making the steps large, the goal is that it will make people feel smaller.</li>

		<li><b>Ladders</b>: There are many ladders throughout the build and, also, the front left corner of the 1st floor is all ladder.  All ladders are designed to lean inwards quite a lot, so it's easier for people to maintain their balance.  The rungs are at one foot spacings.</li>

		<li><b>Swings</b>:  Some simple swings will be constructed off the side of the build.</li>

		<li><b>Banners</b>:  This is a palace, so there will be plenty of space to hang up banners made by theme camps.</li>
