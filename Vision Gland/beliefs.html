		<h2>About Vision Gland</h2>
		<p>
		Vision Gland is a collective of artists in Austin, Texas who most recently collaborated on a celebrated installation entitled "The Vessel" at Austin Tinkering School for E.A.S.T. 2016 (the East Austin Studio Tour). The twelve Vision Gland artists specialize in a kind of collaborative interactive art that is apt to involve the creation of electronic games, interactive kinetic sculpture and immersive exploration experiences that might include secret passageways and hidden control rooms. An operating priciple of this group is that discovery through play shouldn't only be for children (though children love our installations too).<br><br>

		Vision Gland artists are closely tied to Austin art and maker communities, including the Austin Maker Faire and The Austin Tinkering School. Their works have been shown in a variety of venues, including the Hill Country Science Mill, the Austin Maker Faire, the Bob Bullock Texas State History Museum.
