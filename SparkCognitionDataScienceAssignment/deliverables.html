<h1>Spark Cognition Data Science Deliverables</h1>
<h2>If I had time to do it right...</h2>
I want to make it clear that this is one of the most <i>rushed jobs</i> I've ever done.  The circumstances are that I am leaving for a 3 week camping trip in a few days and still in the process of packing.  Given this, I did not have time to research or test much of anything, and what I am submitting is what I could do in the given time to show at least something of an understanding.<br>
<br>
Ideally, this would be a project best solved with some <b>deep learning</b>.  The means of doing this is most likely fairly simple once one becomes familiar with a deep learning library.  Had I the time, I would have researched a good open source implementation, taken the time to set it up correctly, gotten familiar with it's API in the process, and then tested the results until I was getting something good.<br>
<br>
<b>If the included source code doesn't make the grade, I would really appreciate a second try after my vacation.</b>

<h2>Q &amp; A</h2>

<p>
	<b>Describe your model and why did you choose this model over other types of models?</b><br>
	The model I chose in this case was whatever the quickest simplest thing I could do from scratch was: a series of 1 to 1 correlations between the result and every other field, weighted where the divergence is strongest.  This model is not ideal as it only correlates things in a 1:1 way, unlike deep learning with a stronger node depth.  What is interesting about the model I used is that is produces something I may have made up called a "rule set" which awards percentages of likelihood to one option or the other based off the value in the field.  I think this is a pretty cool thing because it can easily be saved to and loaded from string, and can even be calculated by hand.  The percentages don't add up to 100% for each datum, but instead 100% is divided up amongst every reward.  
</p>


<p>
	<b>Describe any other models you have tried and why do you think this model preforms better?</b><br>
	I have tried no others.  Big data analysis is not something that was taught in my school, and I've never had it as a job.  I have done some superficial studying of deep learning algorithms, but have not yet implemented one.
</p>

<p>
	<b>How did you handle missing data?</b><br>
	If data was missing, the size of the dataset was decremented.
</p>

<p>
	<b>How did you handle categorical (string) data? How did you handle unbalanced data?</b><br>
	Categorical data was grouped.  Unbalanced data (numerical?) was divided into localized chunks (based off 10x the average step size between values) and the normal distribution curve was computed for each chunk.  I did not have time to figure out how to compare all the different chunks, and so opted to simply compare the most common curve for each outcome.
</p>

<p>
	<b>How did you test your model?</b><br>
	I passed the training data back through.  The results were atrocious.. even worse than if I tallied up the "yes" and "no" count and used Math.random() to choose between them.  But, given the time constraints and lack of warning, this is what I can show.  I'm sure with another day I could find what a few things making this algorithm spit out such strange results, but, unfortunately I've already spent more time than I have doing this.
