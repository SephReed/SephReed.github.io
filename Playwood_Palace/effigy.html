<h1>DaFT Lead and Effigy Proposal</h1>

<h2>Inspiration and Project Summary:</h2>
The project I am proposing is called the "Playwood Palace".  It is a giant rainbow palace, made to loosely resemble a unicorn.  It is inspired by wood castle playgrounds, in particular, the one from my home town of Healdsburg called Giorgi Park.  It has since been replaced by plastic and metal style playground, but it once was one of the coolest builds I'd ever seen.

<br>
The build is designed with all considerations in mind:
<ul>  
<li>It's safe, deincentivises climbing in unsafe areas while incentivising ladders, and has sturdy design.  </li>
<li>It will burn well, with most of the budget going to 2x4x8 boards, the cheapest wood per pound, and arranged in such a way that it's well airated while still dense.</li>
<li>It uses very little non-wood material.  Screws, joist hangers, perhaps some mylar.  The burn will be non-toxic.</li>
<li>It is sized to fit in the warehouse.</li>
<li>It is designed for flat packing, and uses the same basic components over and over for simple parallel design.</li>
</ul>
Beyond these considerations are the fun parts...


<h2>Planned Features</h2>
<ul id="features">
	<li><b>Slide</b>: 16ft drop over 28 ft span.  Siding and slide made from yuca board (very smooth) with all lips going with downward movement and never against.  Made to <a href="http://www.michigan.gov/documents/dhs/Handbook_for_Public_Safety_CPSC_PUB-325_241534_7.pdf">these playground specs</a></li>

	<li><b>Pulley system</b>:  simple hook pulley system for passing potato sacks and other random shit from the ground to the 1st and 2nd floors and back.</li>

	<li><b>Hidden Space Room</b>:  8ft by 8ft hidden room, accessed through a 4ft tunnel.  Hidden room will be sealed from rain and light, with the interior painted black and muraled to look like space.  It will be black lit and also have mini projectors which will animate a moving galaxy on the ceiling.</li>

	<li><b>Ball Pit</b> : There will be a secret ball pit.  If I tell you where it is, you won't get to experience the joy of finding it yourself.</li>

	<li><b>Hidden Nap Room</b>: 4ft by 8ft, only 4ft tall.  It's a tiny room people will probably fuck in.  Bring your own blanket.</li>

	<li><b>Hidden whip it couch</b>:  The effigy was built around giving this wooden couch a view.  The access to it is a secret ladder which you can only get to through a false wall/door thing.  At about 12ft in the air, it should be a pretty cool little spot.  It might not end up being that secret, it doesn't have to be used for whip its.</li>

	<li><b>Chalkboard wall</b>:  Upon entry, one of the first things people will see is a 8ft by 8ft chalk board wall.  There will be plenty of chalk as well</li>

	<li><b>Mirror maze</b>:  The bottom floor will be a maze.  Much of it will be covered in Mylar.</li>

	<li><b>Towers</b>:  You can stand in them and look cool.</li>

	<li><b>Calming Sounds</b>:  The auditory theme for this build will be heavenly.  Soft harp and strings sounds, with perhaps some falling water and bird songs.  Speakers will be placed throughout the building.</li>

	<li><b>Rainbow Lighting</b>: The lighting at night will be mostly LED strips, with a few color changing bulbs for each of the towers.  The rainbow colors have been very specifically chosen to not be the standard ones, while still close enough to look like a spectrum.  The lighting will move slowly and as fluidly as possible.</li>

	<li><b>Mini Living Rooms</b>:  Throughout the build are many plywood couches.  They are designed to have a nice backwards lean and sunken ass.  On the sides of some of them will be little tables, and in front of the will be little coffee tables.  The intention is to make people feel welcome and comfortable in the space.</li>

	<li><b>Big steps</b>:  The steps are designed to be bigger than average for the sake of making participants feel small again.  The deeper theme of this build is inner child, and by making the steps large, the goal is that it will make people feel smaller.</li>

	<li><b>Ladders</b>: There are many ladders throughout the build and, also, the front left corner of the 1st floor is all ladder.  All ladders are designed to lean inwards quite a lot, so it's easier for people to maintain their balance.  The rungs are at one foot spacings.</li>

	<li><b>Swings</b>:  Some simple swings will be constructed off the side of the build.</li>

	<li><b>Banners</b>:  This is a palace, so there will be plenty of space to hang up banners made by theme camps.</li>
</ul>




<h2>Project Management Summary:</h2>
The process will be divided up mostly into creating the major components, 2 types of beams, and 4 types of decking.  These are repeated over and over for the entire build.  The leaders will be Me, Misty Nickle, and whichever Daftees feel like taking a teaching position.  It should be pretty straight forward, there will be detailed designs for each of the components and a count.  Almost all cuts are from 8 feet to 4.  Very simple.

<h2>Project Plan/Schedule:</h2>
First we'll do the wood couches, so they can double as a place for crew to sit and take a break on build nights.  Then we'll begin on the beams of the bottom floor.  The decking and railing will be finished before repeating the process on the second floor.  Once all beams, decking, and railings are complete, we'll begin making the walls.  There a few small projects that need to happen concurrently, a staircase, some ladders, tower points, unicorn eyes, and the slide.  Once the build is complete, we'll take all the walls off, all the deck chunks out, and beams down to be staged.  They should all flat pack and nest well.<br>
<br>
The timing on everything is hard to estimate, but with so few cuts, and everything so repeated, it's within bounds.  How far within could range from us being done really early, to a few all nighters.  This is my first time doing something like this and I don't know the ratio yet of my time in 3d modeling vs. what it takes in reality for x amount of hands.  That being said, it's less work than I've seen done before in Daft, by a considerable margin.<br>
<br>
<b>Safety:</b> I have had training in project management of teenagers far out in the woods doing trail maintanance, and learned a good eye for safety.  For the most part, no drinking and using table saws, put up railings early, be clever not risky.<br>
<br>
<b>Transportation:</b> Transportation will be more a matter of hands than trucks.  The design is made to flat pack, so space in the usual moving trucks should be fine.  But it is also designed out of lots and lots of boards, which means it will be lots of moving weight, so many hands.    <br>
<br>
<b>Burn:</b> It will burn well, with most of the budget going to 2x4x8 boards, the cheapest wood per pound, and arranged in such a way that it's well airated while still dense.<br>
<br>
<b>Non-Burn:</b> We'll already have experience taking it apart.  Storage of it is an unknown beyond there.<br>
<br>
<b>Cleanup:</b> All ash and steel. <br>
<br>
<b>Budget:</b> Itemized below.
