		The doctor went home, thinking upon their old friend who they had just saved from sickness, carrying their gift.<br><br>
		When they opened the gift, they found something they hadn't seen in years: <i>color</i>.
		<br><br>
		It was a beautiful flowing tapestry, with soothing geometric shapes, and all the colors of the rainbow.  It made them feel as if there was more to the world than logic, and as they hung it up, they thought to themselves: <br><br>"Well, I guess a little magic is okay..."<br>

		Then one day, an acquaintance came up to them and asked: "If you had to choose one between rainbows and unicorns, which do you think is better?"<br><br>
		<i>Well, what a silly question</i> the friends thought, <i>the answer is so obvious.</i>
		<br><br>And so they both answered at the time.

		Weeks later, when the mystic finally woke from their sickly slumber, they were amazed to see what looked like a magnificent white unicorn standing by their bedside.  As they came to their senses, they realized that the unicorn was actually a doctor and the doctor was actually their old friend who had saved them.
		<br><br>

		The mystic was so thankful to have been helped, that they gave their old friend a gift.

		Meanwhile, the friend who liked unicorns didn't go towards science and became a mystic instead.  They spent all their time thinking about magical things that controlled the universe, surrounded in all the most beautiful ideas and treasures they could find.  
		<br><br>But all the beauty, and all the magic was not enough to keep them from getting very, very sick.  So sick, that one day they went to bed and would not wake up.
		<br><br>
		And so, they were taken to the Hospital.

		Eventually the friend who liked rainbows became a scientist.  They spent all their time in clean white rooms, wearing bright white lab coats, living a life without much color.  
		<br><br>Slowly their world became grey and void of magic.

		The two friends looked at each other in astonishment for a moment, before deciding surely it must be a mistake. 
		<br><br>But when the friend who liked unicorns asked the friend who liked rainbows if they meant to say unicorns, they said they did not. 
		<br><br>And when the friend who liked rainbows asked the friend who liked unicorns if they meant to say rainbows, they said "no, I like unicorns more."
		<br><br>So one asked the other, "why don't you like what I like, it is so obvious that mine is better."

		But the friend who liked unicorns wouldn't be persuaded, and was, if anything, angry that the other had implied that unicorns didn't matter just because some people don't believe they exist.  
		<br><br>Each knew they could fight over this forever, so instead they opted to go their separate ways.

		The first friend remained unconvinced, and so responded: "Rainbows are real.  You can make them with crystals, or see them in oil slicks.<br><br>
		They happen when light is refracted in the atmosphere, and they contain the full spectrum of color."

		One friend began: "I think rainbows are better because they come after storms when the sun is shining through, and it makes the Earth so beautiful.<br><br>
		They make you happy and bring good luck, and if you get to the end of one there may even be gold!"

		The other friend retorted: "Well, unicorns are graceful and pure.  So pure that princesses ride them.  
		<br><br>They're magic, they can fly, they have amazing flowing white hair, and they can use their horns to fight off bad guys and heal the sick."
