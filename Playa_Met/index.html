		<h2>About</h2>
		Playa Met is a <i>decentralized, no schedules</i> transit system which utilizes existing Mutant Vehicles to make Deep Playa more accessible and less dangerous. All Playa Met stops will be uniquely designed by artists countrywide, and have tall fuchsia light posts to identify them (similar to porto potties). The deep playa stop will also have shade and act as a safe place for the stranded, injured, or lost to seek help.  
		<br><br>
		The lines both start along the Esplanade at 4:00 and 8:00, meet midway between the Temple and the Man, and extend into Deep Playa (about midway between temple and the tip).
		<br><br>
		The rules of the transit system are simple: 
		<br>
		<i>For art cars</i>: if you pick someone up, you only have to take them to the next stop.  <br>
		<i>For riders</i>: you might only be going from one stop to the next, and must respect requests to disembark.  
		<br><br>
		By organizing the transit system in this way, drivers of art cars can easily choose to grab a few riders and drop them off whenever they happen to be going roughly in the right direction, without any real planning or effort.  
		<br><br>
		In order to validate the feasability of this proposal, we spent three days in the DMV line interviewing art car drivers.  You can find some of their quotes below.
		<br><br>
		If you'd like to read more details about the project, a copy paste of our Honoraria proposal can be found at the bottom of the page.
		<br><br>
		This proposal is currently being backed by "LiL" art collective.  To see more about them, check this link: <a href="https://mistynickle.github.io/LiL/projects.html">MistyNickle.github.io/LiL/projects.html</a>

		<h2>Quotes</h2>
		In 2017, we staked out the line at the DMV and interviewed mutant car owners, trying go get insights on how they might react to this project.  Here are some of their quotes:

		<quote>
			<span>The group that comes in from Thursday leaves all the moop, pisses off the side, doesn't follow any of the guidelines. Pay &amp; Plug camps think they're obligated to get picked up.  I had to about go to the Rangers once, to get some of them off my car.  They said "Fuck You, we're not going to get off."  They think they're entitled. I stay away from that area now</span><br>

		<h3>Copy Paste of Honoraria Proposal</h3>
		<br><br>
		<u>Physical Description</u>
		<p>Every Playa Met stop will have a 20ft pole with a fuschia light atop, fuschia backlit laser cut bus icon signs, and [at least] one bench.  Fuschia is a somewhat unique color on playa and will bring a cohesiveness to the bus stops, similar to the Blue Porto lights, to both identify & draw attention to their consistent presence.
		<br><br>
		At the base of each station is a bench which will be designed & fabricated by various artist collectives (tier 3) that we are affiliated with and esplanade camps near desired stops who have expressed interest.  Each bus stop will be allotted a portion of the budget to create unique thematic benches and/or incorporate offerings like Little Libraries or take/leave gifting.  The Deep Playa stop's budget will also include a shade structure to shield stranded participants from the burning sun, as well as well-lit evening safety from rogue art cars careening around deep playa.
		</p>
		<br><br>
		<u>Interactivity and Mission</u><br>
		Mutant Vehicles are commonly seen as BRC's semi-exclusive lottery of a transit system, sometimes it's amazing, sometimes you get left in Deep Playa.  An incredibly convenient tool for those who own them, a gamble for everyone else.  The purpose of Playa Met stations is to facilitate A to B travel on art cars for the entire community, without schedules or expectations.  There is only one rule:
		<br><br>
		"If you pick someone up, take them to the next stop"
		<br><br>
		We intend to focus primarily on travel to and from Deep Playa, so the planned lines both start at Esplanade, merge mid 12:00 road, and end in Deep Playa.
		<br><br>
		The main missions of this project are:
		<br>-To be a known safe place and rescue point in Deep Playa.
		<br>-To help people get out to deep playa to see the amazing art.
		<br>-To give art cars a way to be less exclusive without catching clingers.
		<br>-To give participants a way to experience a variety art cars.
		<br>-To create human connections, both at the stops and en route.
		<br>-To give drivers a way to be heroes.
