	<h1>Hexapod</h1>
	The Hexapod is an infinite mirrored galaxy housed in a 10â€™ aluminum octahedron. The outside is built as a glistening monolith beaconing participants to explore more. Upon entering the structure the guest find a fractured universe of stars lights and mirrors. By manipulating a spire that juts through the center of the structure, guest can augment the cosmos to fit their dreams.<br><br>

	Our goal is to build different versions of the Hexapod, using the same exterior form and unique interiors to create a large multifaceted installation that grows and changes over time.  Hexapods can stack in an infinite pattern, so each one we make will connect to the next.
