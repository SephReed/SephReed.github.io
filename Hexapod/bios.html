				<b>Leland Drexler-Russell</b> launched TransPlant Design to imbue the world with an added sense of enchantment. He uses special effects techniques to create large scale interactive installations that envelop participants in surreal environs. His inspiration comes from the amazingly diverse flora and fauna found on our earth and speculative astrobiology of faraway worlds. Though he come from an architectural background, he has found creating intriguing experiences to be far more rewarding.

Having started on computers as a toddler, he began programming at age 10 and 3d modelling at 14, and has since moved into the world of fabrication with a focus on immersion and interactivity.  He was the build lead for the highly regarded Vessel by Vision Gland, has worked on large scale metal sculptures for Burning Man, and likes to spend his free time programming with experimental web technology.
